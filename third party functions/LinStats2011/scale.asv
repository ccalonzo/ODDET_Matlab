function d = scale(X, V, dim)
%SCALE divides a vector from each row in a matrix 
% this function predated Matlab's bsxfun, which is a good generalization
% and I would use that inste
%
% data utility to simplify dividing each row in a matrix by a vector
%
% d = scale(X, V)
% X is a m x n matrix
% V is a 1 x n vector. defaults to column sum of X
% d is a new matrix with each row of X divided by V
%
%Example
%   load carbig MPG Acceleration Weight Displacement
%   X = [MPG Acceleration Weight Displacement];
%   z = scale( center( X, mean(X )), std(X)); %zscore
%   z = scale(X, sum(X,1), 2);
